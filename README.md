# **Career Transition into Data and Iot**



For the past years as an Electrical Engineer working on many different fields, I have learned a lot about how data can discover problems, tell stories and find solutions. During my career I have worked on many industries such as : Automotive, Window Manufacturing, Rotational Molding and Oil and Gas.

There have been many challenges in the companies I have worked for, but in the end, it all relates into solving a problem by implementing data analysis to come to a hypothesis of the problem and a answer.

I have developed skills and talents in Testing of electronic Oil and Gas tools using LabVIEW as programming tool. When planning and developing, some external hardware might be needed, I have learned to design my own PCB boards and program the firmware that will help me achieve better results. I have to think about the data that I will gather to validate that the product works. I have learned how to push the data to a database and I have learned how to extract it. In many cases this data never gets analyzed after many years.

I have a passion to solve problems and help to improve my workplace, I like the challenge of finding out what is wrong.  Data can tell a story, find or predict an outcome.  That is why I working on this career change trying to help and solve problems

I also love doing home projects with raspberry pi and open source hardware on which I have developed skill for firmware programming, Python, JavaScript and NodeJS

I hope you find my projects suitable as proof of my skills as programmer and problem solver.
